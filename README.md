# Billionaires Statistics Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the **Billionaires Statistics Dataset** to predict the **industries** in which billionaires operate. Using machine learning techniques, we performed a multiclass classification task to achieve this goal.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Billionaires Statistics Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/billionaires-statistics-dataset)
- **Target Feature**: `Industries`

The dataset includes features related to billionaires' demographics, wealth distribution, and more, providing rich data for classification.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to predict the `Industries` category using various machine learning algorithms. The predictions are based on features such as net worth, age, citizenship, and source of wealth.

## Machine Learning Models Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Feature scaling for better model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualizing key trends and distributions in the dataset.
   - Identifying correlations between features.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Training the models using scikit-learn.
   - Evaluating model accuracy and performance metrics.

## Results

- **Best Performing Model**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: 72.57% 
  - Other metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score (if calculated).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Libraries**: 
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `NumPy` for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
